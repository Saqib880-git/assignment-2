     <h3>People’s education society was founded by Nithya Sachiva Sri. K.V. Shankara gowda. His vision was 
        to provide to the people of Mandya a prestigious educational institution-which would focus on quality 
        education. Students of Mandya district in particular and students of neighbouring districts, in general, have 
        been benefited from the institution. The demise of Sri K.V.Shankara gowda made way to Sahakara Rathna 
        Sri Dr.H.D Chowdaiah as a chairman of the Society  After his retirement the mantle of chairmanship has 
        been passed on to the young and energetic Sri K.S.Vijay Anand. People’s Education Society(P.E.S.) is now 
       called People’s Education Trust(P.E.T).
